# Green Stock Analysis 

## Overview of the project
- Using the Visual Basic Apllication in excel, we helped Steve analze a data set to determine if a stock was worth investing in, based on the stock's total daily volume and yearly return. After completing the first analysis, we reused the macros created in the first analysis to to analyze 11 more stock to see which stock would be the smartest option.

## Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to learn how to use VBA to automate tasks and perform function that organize and analyze large datasets. By creating and running macros in VBA, we were able to analyze the large dataset into readable date that could depict how a stock performed in a certain year. In order to make the analysis run faster and efficiently, we learned how to refactor that code. 

## Results
- In order to make the code more efficient and maintanable, we needed to refactor the code. Refactoring means looping through the data at one time and collect all of the needed information.
